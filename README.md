# Code for "Robust worst-case scenarios from ensemble forecasts"

This repository contains the code developed for the paper "Robust worst-case scenarios from ensemble forecasts"
by Sebastian Scher, Stephen Jewson and Gabriele Messori

`get_ecmwf_data_3.sh` downloads the ECMWF forecast data. It is written to 
be used on the ecgate cluster of ECMWF, and needs to be adapted in order
to be used with the open web API.

The python scripts contain all code for the analysis of the ECMWF data.

The data folder contains intermediate results.
